## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? ##

The client was Liam and he wanted a system built that helps student drivers to prepare for their driving test and also take driving lessons to improve their driving skills. System relies on appointments and communication with driving tutors who comes to locations to pick up the students.

## What did you do particularly well? ##

I have designed system functions and how it will be run and I think it is pretty solid design documents to help the development team in building it. Using diagrams and requirements I have put together document to help build the system from scratch.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? ##

I would revise the diagrams to make them simpler and easier to understand. And to improve it, I would add more leniency and relationships between nodes and space them out so it doesn't look very overwhelming at first glance.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? ##

User needed a system that users can login to and schedule lesson appointments. Since users needs to be able to access the system anytime, a web application was more suited for this requirement. User's needs has to be considered before going into what type of system it will be and how it will be run.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? ##

I approached it by first focusing on what is the most important feature required from the system. This one's requirement is that user needs to be able to access it easily and anytime. As for next time, I will focus on the budget and development team's size before focusing on the system requirements because it can help with budget allocation and time requirements.
